Getting Ready
=============

Assignment Repository
---------------------

.. TODO: Demo link added - will need to remove

Set up the repository that you will use to submit most assignments for
this course by following the directions in the `main
README Demo <https://github.com/speudusa/liftoff-project-assignments>`__
of the ``speudusa/liftoff-assignments`` repo.

.. admonition:: Note

   link updated to Courtney's demo repo idea.

   Will need restore to original link, or make changes to liftoff repo then restore correct link.

Trello
------

One team member will need to create a free `Trello <https://trello.com/>`_ account for your team. 
This same team member should create a project board and then invite teammates to the board.
Once all your team has joined your Trello board, you can start adding user stories and assigning or delegating tasks. 

On your new board, create 3 lists. From left to right, name these:

- Next
- In Progress
- Done

Trello is a project management tool. 
You will use it to assign/delegate tasks, document progress, and organize tasks while working together on your project.  
A single board typically contains all of the information and tasks for a specific project. 


Git Refresher
-------------

You will be using Git extensively throughout this course. 
Read our :ref:`git-refresher`, and use the :ref:`git-workflow` as a reference for your team project.
