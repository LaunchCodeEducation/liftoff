Getting Ready
=============

Assignment Repository
---------------------

.. TODO: Demo link added - will need to remove

Set up the repository that you will use to submit most assignments for
this course by following the directions in the `main
README Demo <https://github.com/speudusa/liftoff-project-assignments>`__
of the ``speudusa/liftoff-assignments`` repo.

.. admonition:: note

   link updated to Courtney's demo repo idea.

   Will need to fix it 

Trello
------

Create a free `Trello <https://trello.com/>`_ account for your team. 
Trello is a project management tool. 
You will use it to document and organize tasks while working together on your project. 

One team member should create an account and a project board.  
Once the board is complete, share the link with your team members and make sure everyone can join.
Once all your team has joined your trello, start adding user stories and tasks. 

A single board typically contains all of the information and tasks for a specific project. 
On your new board, create 3 lists. From left to right, name these:

- Next
- In Progress
- Done

Git Refresher
-------------

You will be using Git extensively throughout this course. 
Read our :ref:`git-refresher`, and use the :ref:`git-workflow` as a reference for your team project.
