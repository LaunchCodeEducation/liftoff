Liftoff Overview
================

Liftoff is an 8 week class with two objectives:

#. Complete a significant amount of work towards a project.
#. Be prepared for the job interview process.

Class time will be similar to LC101. You will complete prep work before each
class. During class there will be a lecture or discussion, and small-group
activities. You will be required to work on assignments
outside of class, including working on your team project.

This class varies from LC101 in that you will be required to
perform a lot of *independent* work on your team project. No one is going to tell
you what to build and you will not be given a list of requirements. It will
be up to you to make many decisions as you build your team project. 
We will support and guide you along the way, but ultimately the success of your team project rests on you.

Liftoff Expectations
--------------------

-  Class attendance and participation
-  Completion of all assignments
-  Visible progress on your project every week

Making a project, especially your first team project, can be a daunting task. 
You will have to work on your project multiple times a week outside of class, 
in addition to the prep work and assignments. 
Since you are working on a team project, 
you may have to schedule working time with your team outside of class.  
We estimate that you will need to work at least **20 hours each week** to make it through this course successfully.  

Team Project Overview
---------------------

The capstone project is one of the most important pieces of landing the
perfect LaunchCode apprenticeship. Your team project is one of the primary
ways that LaunchCode and potential employers will verify that you are
job-ready, and it should be something that you're proud to show off. So
don't skimp on the time, energy, and thought that you put into this!

Be unique, innovative and creative. Your team project should demonstrate
meaningful thought and planning, and that you can build software from
the ground up.

Your project should:

#. **Demonstrate marketable skills**: You have a strong foundation in at
   least one language that is widely used by professional developers,
   and the related tools and best practices. You can apply your
   programming skills within a professional-grade framework or tools
   like ASP.NET MVC or Spring Boot.

#. **Demonstrate your ability to learn new things**: In your project,
   you will go beyond your initial learning to teach yourself something
   new. Maybe you learned Angular.js for your front-end web project, or
   connected to an API in your back-end Java application.
   Don’t forget how your team learns too.  Did you discover new things together? 
   Did you share something with the team that made your code more efficient?  
   Did a teammate suggest a way to handle a troublesome bug?  
   The ability to learn on your own is good, but the ability to learn from others and teach others is equally important.

#. **Solve a problem**: When employed as a programmer, you'll be asked
   to implement solutions to problems. Your capstone project should
   demonstrate that you are capable of identifying a problem and coming
   up with a software-based solution to the problem. 
   
   .. admonition:: Example

      Creating an app that allows a nonprofit to organize and communicate
      with volunteers solves a meaningful problem. Creating a Sudoku app
      doesn't.

Your Team's GitHub Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a team, you will work from a single repo on GitHub.  
The team’s project manager is responsible for creating this repo and the Trello board.  
All other team members will need to clone the repo to work on it locally.  
Ideally, each team member should try to avoid working directly on the main branch, 
especially if working on a new feature.  
If you are all working together, then figure out your best branching strategy.

You will put your project up in GitHub. This will make it accessible for
others to view, and will show off all of the hard work you put into it
as you rack up commits!  

.. admonition:: Note

   Keep the following in mind as you work on your team project:

   * Your commits will be visible in the codebase and on your own GitHub page.
   * Providing helpful commit messages and branch names can be useful to your teammates.
   * Adding comments to your code can be very helpful to your teammates, as well as yourself.

With your project on GitHub, it is accessible for others to view, and will show off all of the hard work you put into it as you rack up commits!  

Team Project Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Regardless of the project your team tackles, you should:
   * **Build an application entirely as a team from scratch**, or nearly so. 
      If you use starter code, you need to go well beyond what was provided or worked on by others. 
      You should be able to clearly articulate what you built yourself versus what was built by others.
   * **Include 3-5 significant features**. 
      Each feature should add a new component to your project but not be so small as to be trivial. 
      It’s difficult to define what a significant feature is, but we’ll help you understand as you go. 

.. admonition:: Example
   
   Adding a new button to your web project? Probably not significant enough.

   Creating a discussion forum? That’s too big.
   
   Adding user authentication? Yep, that’s great!

   Other idea for project demos:  could students make a google site?
