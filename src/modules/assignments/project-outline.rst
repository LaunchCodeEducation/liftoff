Assignment: Project Outline
===========================

For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your
project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular,
your mentor will provide feedback and direction to help sharpen your
ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the
outline, or if you have to change some things later.


Creating Your Outline
---------------------

Within your ``liftoff-assignments`` repository, open up
``P2-Project_Outline/README.md``. You'll see a few sections headings in
place for you. 

As a team, flesh out your project outline by providing:

1. **Overview**: In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an "elevator pitch" for your
   project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in
   non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find
   useful about it? Where did the idea come from?

2. **Features**: List 5-7 features that you will implement in your
   project. Each feature should have a name and a 1-2 sentence
   description. Here are a few examples for a blog application:

   -  **User login**: Users will be able to create accounts and log in
      to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
   -  **Search**: Users will be able to search for blog posts containing
      given text.
   -  **Create Post**: Users will be able to create new blog posts when
      logged in. New posts will appear in the user's profile.
   -  **Post Tags**: Users will be able to create tags for blog posts which can be used to sort and filter posts
   -  **Scheduled Posting**: Allow users to schedule the dates and times they would like blogs posted.

3. **Technologies**: What languages and technologies will you use to
   build your application? 
   
   For example, the Unit 2 coding-events application was created in either Java or C#, depending on which language you learned.  
   The technologies to make this application in either language would include the following:
   
   - Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, and Thymeleaf templates
   - C#, ASP.NET Core, MySQL, and Postman

4. **What you'll have to learn**: In the course of building your
   project, you'll have to learn something new. Perhaps you want to use
   data from a public API, or add a bit of JavaScript to make your
   front-end more interactive. If you can't name the exact technology or
   technique that you'll have to learn, you should still be able to
   describe a problem that you have identified that you don't currently
   know how to solve.

5. **Project Tracker**: Link to your *team* Trello board here.

6. **Enable GitHub Issues**: If you haven't already enabled :ref:`GitHub
   Issues <github-issues>` do so before submitting
   this assignment. If you haven't enabled GitHub Issues yet your mentor
   will not be able to give you feedback on your project!

Submitting Your Outline
-----------------------

Once you have finished your project outline, commit and push your
changes to your repository and submit the assignment on Canvas by
submitting the URL to your outline. Your mentor will provide feedback
after the assignment deadline.
