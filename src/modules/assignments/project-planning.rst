Assignment: Project Planning
=============================

For this assignment, you’ll create some initial plans for your project,
and create your project’s repo.

Getting Started
---------------

Within your ``liftoff-assignments`` repository, open up
``P3-Project_Planning/README.md``. You’ll see a couple of section
headings in place for you. Flesh out your project plan by creating:

1. A wireframe for each page in the MVP of your project, at least 3
   total. These can be hand-drawn wireframes that you have photographed
   using your smartphone, or they can be PDF or image exports from a
   tool like `Moqups <https://moqups.com/>`__ or Google Drawings.
   Regardless of how you create them, your wireframes should be clear
   and readable, and they should be added as files within your Git
   repository. Be sure to submit following the formatting directives in
   the README, **which includes adding your images to your repo, along
   with links to them within the README.** Consult `GitHub’s markdown
   reference <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>`__
   as necessary.
2. A link to your *public* project tracker (i.e. Trello). As part of the setup for this class, you created a project tracker and a
   project. Make sure you have added your MVP user stories, and moved
   your initial stories into the "Next" column. Your
   stories should be clear and formatted as proper user stories and not
   just tasks.
3. Create your initial project repository in GitHub. Don’t worry, you
   can always rename this later. Link this in the above README as well.

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

Once you have finished both wireframe and user story components, commit
and push your changes to your ``liftoff-assignments`` repository and
submit the assignment on Canvas by submitting the URL to your outline.
Your mentor will provide feedback after the assignment deadline.
