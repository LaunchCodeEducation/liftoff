Assignment: Deployment
======================

This is an optional assignment, but one that is highly recommended.

**Deploying** your app means setting up a server or service that hosts
your app publicly on the Internet. Deploying your project is a great way to
learn about the deployment process, which is part of every development
team's workflow. It also gives you a way to point potential employers,
mentors, and others to a working version of your application.

How To Deploy Your App
----------------------

This varies quite a bit based on the language and framework your app
uses, along with the particular host or service you are using. We provide
resources on deploying Spring Boot applications to Pivotal Cloud
Foundry, and on deploying .NET MVC applications to Azure App Service.

.. note:: 

   If your project is not a Java or C# project, consult an instructor or your mentor for guidance on hosting and deployment.
