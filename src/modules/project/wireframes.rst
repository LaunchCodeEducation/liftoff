Wireframes
==========

User Experience (UX)
--------------------


UX is short for “user experience”, and is the design discipline focused
on making products that place primary importance on a user’s experiences
and interactions. A critical part of the UX design process is
wireframing, which is a technique used to sketch out web pages and views
in a rough way that focuses on how elements are arranged and how users
are likely to interact with them.

This isn’t a design class, and most developers work with designers to
create the best products possible. While you won’t be expected to be an
expert at UX and design, it is important to have an appreciation for the
elements of design and have a user focus when working on your project.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
----------------------------

MVP is short for Minimum Viable Product which is a product with just
enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for
future product development. This should be your goal throughout Liftoff.
You will not have a fully fleshed out project that is completly
polished. What you will have is a great start, and the ability to
continue working on your project.

Last class we talked a bit about what you should build for your personal
project. In our next class we will talk more about creating an MVP.

From User Stories and Wireframes to Code
----------------------------------------

In order to be successful in Liftoff you will be required to turn your
ideas, and skills into an actual project. This is a difficult task. In
class we will not be writing code, but instead focusing on concepts that
will help you work on your project. *You will be required to create your
project outside of class!*

There are no secrets or shortcuts to completing a project. It takes lots
of time, hard work, and working through frustrating bugs. You should
commit to working on your project as much as possible. One night a week
will likely not be enough to finish your project. We believe one of the
best ways to hold yourself accountable is by using User Stories,
Wireframes, and having regular meetings with your mentor where you
update them on what you have done.

In class we will talk about taking our user stories and wireframes and
turning them into actual code.

To get a head start, review the demo projects created by Chris, and Paul.
Pay attention to the user stories they wrote, and then look at their
GitHub profiles to see the code they had to create.
