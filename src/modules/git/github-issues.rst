GitHub Issues
=============

Standard GitHub Repository
--------------------------

In order to receive feedback from your mentor you will need to enable
GitHub Issues. GitHub Issues is usually setup automatically for new
repositories.

Here is a picture of an example GitHub Project Repo.

The tabs for this project are Code, Issues, Pull requests, Projects,
Wiki, Insights, and Settings.

If I click the Issues tab it looks like this.

My issues are already enabled! I can create a new issue by clicking the
large green New Issue button.

Enabling GitHub Issues
----------------------

Letâ€™s look at the same repository after I have turned off Issues in the
settings tab.

You can see that the Issues tab is no longer present!

In order to turn this on I must select the Settings tab.

The settings page has a ton of configurable options, you should look
around and see what is possbile! On the Main page shown above you can
see the big Features heading in that heading are 4 checkboxes, and the
Issues checkbox is unchecked. By clicking that checkbox, it will enable
the Issues tab.

When I check the Issues button it automatically takes effect, and you
can see from the image above that it adds the Issues tab back in for me!
