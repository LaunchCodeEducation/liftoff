Mastering the Technical Interview
=================================

Introduction 
------------

Interviewing for a programming or other technical job can be stressful. 
In a short period of time, a company must try to understand whether or 
not a candidate has the skills to be successful in the role. 
In the same limited time, the candidate has to convey their true potential. 
This process is stressful for candidates, and difficult for everyone.

Technical interviews have historically been a complicated and 
fraught aspect of the tech industry. Many forms of technical interview 
don’t necessarily screen for the skills that are the most important 
predictors of success on the job. Candidates can feel unduly stressed 
by these interviews, leading to situations where they don’t fully 
convey the depth of their skills to an employer. 

   A candidate might miss out on a job opportunity that they would excel at, and an employer might miss out on a great employee.


As an industry, we’re all still working this out. Educators, employers, 
and aspiring programmers are continually working to better prepare and screen candidates. 
Aspiring programmers are constantly trying to do better in technical interviews.

At LaunchCode, we have a lot of experience with technical interviews. 
Many of our staff have previously (or still do) work as developers, and 
have gone through the hiring process from both sides. And LaunchCode 
has placed individuals at hundreds of different companies across the country, 
each of which has a slightly different technical interview process. 

This guide intends to distill the best and most useful information 
about technical interviews, as we see them play out day-by-day. 
The industry will continue to evolve its practices, and we will 
continue to adapt this guide--as well as our education programs--to prepare 
aspiring developers to be as successful as possible. 
We’ll focus on interviews for programming jobs, but many of the same 
dynamics and principles apply for other technical jobs. 

Technical Interviews: What, Why, and How
----------------------------------------

An interview for a programming job involves two high-level types 
of evaluation: technical and behavioral. These evaluations can take place in a 
single interview, or be spread across multiple interviews. Some companies will 
initially screen candidates with a relatively short behavioral interview 
conducted by a non-technical employee (often from their Human Resources Department), 
followed by a more in-depth interview involving the technical hiring manager 
and possibly other members of the team. 

Behavioral and technical portions are sometimes part of the same interview. 
And in some cases there will be multiple components to the technical screening. 
When beginning the interview process with a company, ask your interviewer what 
the interview process will be like. If interviewing for a job through LaunchCode, 
your contact on the Company Relations Team may also be able to give you an idea 
of what to expect for the given company and team. 

For the purposes of this guide, we’ll refer to “behavioral interviews” and 
“technical interviews”, but keep in mind that these can be part of the same 
actual meeting, or might be spread across different meetings.

**Behavioral interviews** give the company an idea of what type of coworker you would be. 
They cover soft skills like communication, drive, and responding to adversity. 
They can also cover non-technical planning skills, like project and task management. 
We don’t discuss behavioral interviews in depth in this guide, 
but keep in mind that they can be just as, and in some cases more, 
important than technical interviews in determining whether or not you get the job. 

**Technical interviews** are intended to give the company a clear picture of the depth 
and breadth of your technical skills. This is a very, very difficult goal to achieve in 
a short period of time. The only truly reliable test of how you will contribute to a 
team as a programmer is to actually go through the process of working on the team for some period of time. 
An apprenticeship gives the company an opportunity to evaluate your skills properly, 
but they’ll still want to have a good idea of what your skills are like before committing to you as 
an apprentice, so that they have confidence that the apprenticeship will be successful.
