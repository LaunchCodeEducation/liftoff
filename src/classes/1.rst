Class 1: Class Overview, Project Planning
=========================================

Objectives
----------

Project Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Understand the goal of creating a capstone project
-  Explain the key components of a meaningful project
-  Generate an idea for a project that meets the provided criteria
-  Describe Story Mapping, Epics, and User Stories.
-  Create user stories that clearly identify the targeted user and

Prep Work
---------

To hit the ground running in class one we need to cover a lot of ground!
We need to:

* Set up a GitHub repository so we can upload our assignments
* Understand what makes a *good* capstone project
* Learn about **user stories**. 

We want to handle as much setup and logistical work as possible now so the
remaining weeks of the class we can focus on making progress on our
projects!

Tasks
^^^^^

Before class, complete these modules:

* :ref:`liftoff-overview`
* :ref:`setup`
* :ref:`user-stories`

We will spend time in class talking about project ideas in small groups.
**Come to class with 1-2 ideas for projects you might want to work on.**

.. tip:: 

   If you are struggling to come up with ideas check out our :ref:`demo-projects`, as well as `project demo videos made by previous students <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8LRJHkTqsg&list=PLs5n5nYB22fIdV_HMkekxx7Yt06lXUptT>`__

In Class
--------

Lecture: How do you ideate, and build a project?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In class today, we will have a lecture and discussion on how to ideate
and build a project. Most people struggle to build projects, especially
their first project. In this class, we are going to learn some concepts
that aren’t necessarily programming skills, but should help manage the
building of your project.

Before lecture today, please take a few minutes to think about how you
would build a project. What steps would need to take to build a
project?

Activity: Get to know your group!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each class will have you check in with your group. Since we don’t have
much work to talk about yet, let’s take some time to get to know each
other.

Circle up and go around the group starting with the group’s mentor.
Introduce yourself, state what you want to get out of this class, and
finally state at least one idea you have for a project for this class.

Lecture: Story mapping, user stories, and epics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a brief lecture, let’s talk about some of the key ways companies plan
and organize their work while working on technical products. Then, let’s
see an example of how to use these tools!

Example: Attendance App User Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Watch the instructor take the example idea and write some user stories.

Activity: Solidify Project Idea & Write user stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you didn’t come to an agreement with your mentor about which project
you will be working on, now is the time to do so! If you need a few
extra minutes to decide on a project, let your mentor know and you can
talk it out together. Remember that this is just the first project of
many projects to come! If you’ve got a killer idea that might be
slightly out of the scope of this class you can always put it on hold
until after this class ends.

After choosing a project and having it confirmed by your mentor, write
some user stories for your idea. Consider what you need to do as the
developer. What does the end user need? What other users might there be for
this application?

You must have your mentor approve at least one of your user stories to
count towards your attendance today!

Regroup: Instructor Overview, and Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The instructor should have a few additional user stories for the example
Attendance application idea and will show you what they have to do to
complete the user story!
