To hit the ground running in class one we need to cover a lot of ground!
We need to:

* Set up a GitHub repository so we can upload our assignments
* Understand what makes a *good* capstone project
* Learn about **user stories**. 

We want to handle as much setup and logistical work as possible now so the
remaining weeks of the class we can focus on making progress on our
projects!

Tasks

Before class, complete these modules:

* :ref:`liftoff-overview`
