<p>Live coding is a part of the interview process. The best way to prepare
for live coding is to practice, practice, practice. Today we will see a
strategy for solving live coding problems and we will get more practice in
class.</p>
<div class="section" id="live-coding-demo">
<h2>Live Coding Demo<a class="headerlink" href="#live-coding-demo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Watch a demonstration of the live coding process, focusing on the steps followed.
An interviewer is more concerned with your problem-solving process than the
correctness of your answer, so following this detailed, logical, step-by-step process
is the best way to demonstrate your skills.</p>

<div class="section" id="gather-requirements">
<h3>Gather Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#gather-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the video, the interviewer gave us requirements but they were
intentionally vague. The first thing the interviewee had to do was to
gather additional requirements to have a strong understanding of the
problem.</p>
<p>This required communication on the interviewee’s behalf. They went as
far as to talk through the given input, and create an output that was
verified as correct by the interviewer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="break-the-problem-down">
<h3>Break the Problem Down<a class="headerlink" href="#break-the-problem-down" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After successfully gathering the requirements, the interviewee broke the
problem down into two separate pieces. Identifying what needed to be done
first, and what needed to be done next.</p>
<p>Breaking the problem down gives the interviewee the opportunity to focus
on one aspect of the problem at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pseudocode">
<h3>Pseudocode<a class="headerlink" href="#pseudocode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once the interviewee has a hold on the separate pieces of their intended
solution, they can begin working on the logic of the problem.</p>
<p>For the first chunk of their proposed solution, the interviewee wrote
“Loop over input, remove vowels”.</p>
<p>For the second portion of their proposed solution, the interviewee wrote
“Loop over vowel-less str, remove odd index chars”.</p>
<p>Psuedocoding the problem promotes communication around the proposed
solution. It is a way to share thoughts with the interviewer without
starting to code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="write-syntax">
<h3>Write Syntax<a class="headerlink" href="#write-syntax" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have a plan, and a map drawn out in the form of our
pseudocode, we can start coding!</p>
<p>You’ll notice the interviewee is talking through their actions as they
write code down. This shows the interviewee has the ability to
communicate effectively with another developer.</p>
<p>As you write syntax, you may find that you still don’t have all of the
requirements. In this video, the interviewee did not know if the letter
‘y’ was considered a vowel. To overcome this confusion, they simply asked
the interviewer for more clarity on the requirements!</p>
<p>While writing their code, occasionally the interviewee would realize
they didn’t declare a variable before, or forgot to include something
above their already written code. That is okay! You want to show the
interviewer your problem-solving process. Very rarely will you write
something perfect from top to bottom. Don’t hesitate adding new lines
above your already written solution if you need to declare more
variables!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="test">
<h3>Test<a class="headerlink" href="#test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the interviewee finishes the first version of their solution, they
need to test it! As programmers, we don’t usually get the right answer on
the first try. Without our debugger to point us in the correct
direction, we are left to walking through a test case ourselves.</p>
<p>You’ll notice the interviewee keeps track of the variables throughout
the entire program by writing them on the board and updating them as
they step through the program line by line.</p>
<p>At the end of the program, the interviewee can compare their produced
answer and compare it to the answer that was agreed upon when they
gathered the requirements of this problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="make-changes">
<h3>Make Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#make-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When testing your solution, you will more than likely find that you made
a mistake. It may be a small mistake, or a big mistake. Making a mistake
can be a great thing in a live coding session. Take a step back and try
to figure out where the mistake is happening. This is usually very
apparent in the testing phase if you test line by line.</p>
<p>You want to show the interviewer you have strong problem-solving skills
and part of problem-solving is being able to figure out mistakes you
have made in your own solution and then fixing them.</p>
<p>If you find a mistake in your solution, great! Fix the mistake, and test
your solution again.</p>
