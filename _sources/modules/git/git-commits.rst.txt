Regular Git Commits
===================

Version Control is an invaluable skill as a developer. It allows you
keep track of the different versions of your project. As a record of
everything you have done, it provides some useful benefits:

-  Review code you, or other developers, wrote in the past
-  `Undo mistakes you make in your
   project <https://blog.github.com/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/>`__
-  Create branches that give you a clean space to work on new ideas
   without jeopardizing the current state of your project

In Liftoff, we will be using Git as our version control software. If you
completed LC101, you were introduced to the basics of the Git workflow:
staging (``git add``), committing (``git commit``), and pushing to a remote
repository (``git push``).

If you feel a little rusty on some of the basics, take a look at the `Git
Handbook <https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/>`__
created by GitHub!

Commit Yourself to Using Git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You won't get the benefits of Git listed above, if you don't use it!

You should incorporate Git into your coding work. When you've finished a
user story, you should stage, commit, and push. When you've squashed a
bug, you should stage, commit, and push. If you are working before bed,
before you call it a night, you should stage, commit, and push. If you
are working before work, you should stage, commit, and push before you
have to leave. The more versions you have of your project, the more
places you can revert back to.

As you advance in your career, you will learn more appropriate times to
stage, commit, and push. Most teams, or companies, define when their
developers should stage, commit, and push. Some companies will want you
to only commit if you have finished a user story. Others may want you to
create a branch for everything you do, and so staging, committing, and
pushing is left up to you, but you are only allowed to merge your branch
when you've met certain conditions.

*As you are working on your personal project, you can and should commit
as often as you'd like.*

Hiring Managers Love Active GitHub Profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every time you make a contribution to your GitHub profile (pushing to a
master branch, merging a branch into master, creating a new repository,
etc.), GitHub records your contribution and displays it to the public.

Let's take a look.

   Active GitHub Profile

As you can see, Paul has made 541 contributions in the last year. You can
see a heatmap showing when and how many contributions Paul made over the
past year. From this information, you can see he regularly codes. He has
dedicated much of his time to programming and very rarely does a full
week go by where he doesn't contribute in some way. Most weeks he
contributes multiple things.

Everyone's profile looks the same when they start and by regularly
staging, committing, and pushing work to your project repository, you
will start to build up contributions. Set a goal for yourself to
contribute to your GitHub account a certain number of times each week.
By the end of this class, you will have the start of a GitHub profile
that catches the interest of hiring managers.

You will learn more about making a good GitHub profile in the prep work
around Online Profiles.
