Assignment: Project Review
==========================

During class, you'll spend 15-20 minutes with your mentor reviewing
your project work to date. This will be less of a pair programming
exercise and more of a code review exercise. Your mentor will check in
with you on things like:

-  What stories have you been working on recently?
-  What code design decisions did you make and why? For example, how did you design your model classes and controllers?
-  What has been the most challenging aspect of your project so far? How did you overcome it?
-  What are you working on next? Your mentor will provide some tips for your next set of stories.

If you have made progress on your project and you engage with your
mentor to talk through your project, then
you'll be marked as having completed this assignment.
