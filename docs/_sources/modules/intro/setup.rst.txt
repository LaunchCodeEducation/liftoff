Getting Ready
=============

Assignment Repository
---------------------

Set up the repository that you will use to submit most assignments for
this course by following the directions in the `main
README <https://github.com/launchcodeeducation/liftoff-assignments>`__
of the ``LaunchCodeEducation/liftoff-assignments`` repo.

Trello
------

Create a free `Trello <https://trello.com/>`_ account. Trello is a project management tool. You will use it to document and organize tasks while working on your project. 

After creating your account, create a new board for your project. A single board typically contains all of the information and tasks for a specific project.

Git Refresher
-------------

You will be using Git extensively throughout this course. Read our :ref:`git-refresher`, and if you plan on working on a group project, also read the :ref:`git-workflow`.
