Git for Projects
================

You’ve become comfortable using Git for version control on your
projects and assignments. However, you likely haven’t used the same Git
repository to collaborate with others. It should come as no surprise to
you that in the professional tech world, developers are working in the
same code base all the time!

Aside from tracking your changes to a project, Git also enables
efficient collaboration with others. This means that there are
mechanisms for combining different groups of changes (*merging*), for
sharing code remotely (*using remote repositories*), and for carrying
out different sets of tasks within the same repository (*branching*).
We’ll learn about these in more detail.
