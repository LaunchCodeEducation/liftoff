Licensing
=========

As a software developer, almost anything you create is your own
**intellectual property**. This means that you own it and thus have
control over whether or not others can use it. Similarly, when you use
software or code written by other people, you are only doing so with
their permission. Licenses are legal tools used to specify who can use
software, and how. As a developer, it is critically important that you
are aware of licenses and that you follow them properly when using code
written by others.

While your first instinct may be to prevent others from using your work,
that is often not the best choice. Many software developers and
companies choose to allow others to use their code, which is great!
Think about some of the tools, libraries, and frameworks that you've
used throughout your learning. Most, if not all, of these were used
legally via **open source licenses**. Such licenses ensure that
developers can share and use code appropriately, making the world of
development a better place for everyone!
