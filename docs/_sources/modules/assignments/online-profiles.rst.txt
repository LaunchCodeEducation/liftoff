Assignment: Online Profiles
===========================

The goal of this assignment is for you to spend some time building a
technical resume, creating a professional LinkedIn account, and updating
your GitHub profile to highlight your projects.

Profiles
--------

Within your ``liftoff-assignments`` repository, open up
``C1-Online_Profiles/README.md``. You will need to add:

-  a .PDF of your resume
-  a link to your GitHub profile
-  A link to your LinkedIn profile.

Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository. Your Mentor
will then be able to provide you with feedback via GitHub issues.

Alternate Submissions
---------------------

If you are unwilling to upload your resume to GitHub you will still be
responsible for getting your resume to your Mentor to grade. Talk to
them in class about the best way to get them your resume. They may have
you print out a physical copy, or email/slack them a digital copy, or
they may want to see your resume during class.
