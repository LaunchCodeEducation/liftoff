Assignment: Project Setup
=========================

This assignment will get you set up and rolling with a basic project. By
the end, you will have a GitHub repo that contains a working
application.

Getting Started
---------------

The objectives for this assignment are simple to state:

-  Create a GitHub repository for your project, which includes a license
-  Make an initial commit that includes a basic, working "Hello, world!"
   level project
-  Start working on your first user story

There are some situation-specific tips below. If you have questions
about getting started on your project that are not covered here, talk to
your mentor or the instructor.

Pre-existing Projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you've already started a project, make sure it's in GitHub. Once you
check that one off, take the extra step of creating a solid README file
that gives a high-level overview of your project so that visitors to
your profile can learn about it.

Java / Spring Boot Project Tips
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Revisit `lesson

from the Java / Spring Boot skill track as needed. In particular, if
you're starting from scratch, you'll find these useful:

-  `Intro to Spring Boot:
   Controllers <http://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-java/videos/intro-to-spring-boot-controllers/>`__
   - for creating a basic "Hello, world!" application
-  `Using Git in
   IntelliJ <http://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-java/videos/using-git-in-intellij/>`__
   - for connecting your local Git repository to a GitHub repository

C# / ASP.NET MVC Project Tips
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Revisit `lesson
videos <http://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-csharp/videos/>`__
from the C# / ASP.NET skill track as needed. In particular, if you're
starting from scratch you'll find these useful:

-  `Intro to ASP.NET Core MVC:
   Controllers <http://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-csharp/videos/intro-to-mvc-controllers/>`__
   - for creating a basic "Hello, world!" application
-  `Intro to Visual
   Studio <http://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-csharp/videos/intro-to-visual-studio/>`__
   - for connecting your local Git repository to a GitHub repository

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

Within your ``liftoff-assignments`` repository, open up
``P4-Project_Setup/README.md``. Using Markdown formatting, add a link to
your project repository. Then stage, commit, and push your changes.

Once you have finished both wireframe and user story components, commit
and push your changes to your ``liftoff-assignments`` repository, and
submit the assignment on Canvas by submitting the URL to your outline.
Your mentor will provide feedback after the assignment deadline.
