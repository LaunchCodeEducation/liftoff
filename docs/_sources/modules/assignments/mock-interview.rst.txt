Assignment: Mock Interview
==========================

For this assignment, you will go through a mock interview. The mock
interview should last between 15-20 minutes, and you will be asked
behavioral interview questions.

Your interviewer is going to check that you are answering questions
correctly and using experiences from your life as evidence to your
answers.

You do not need to submit anything. Your score will be recorded in
Canvas for you. If you don't pass the assignment this time, you will
need to schedule another mock interview with the course instructor.
