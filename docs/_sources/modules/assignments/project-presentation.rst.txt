Assignment: Project Presentation
================================

Odds are you aren’t done with your project. That’s okay. In fact, we
encourage you to continue to work on your project well beyond the end of
the Liftoff program, so that you continue to learn and keep your skills
sharp. And if you ever feel “done” with your project, start a new one!
There’s no better way to acquire and demonstrate skills than by working
on a project.

That said, we want to you to create a set of presentation slides
summarizing your project. This serves multiple purposes: 1. It shows us
what you’ve accomplished to-date. 2. It forces you to go through the
process of outlining your project work at a high level, which is a
useful exercise to prepare you to talk about it in interviews. It also
makes it easy for you to give an actual presentation on your app in the
future. 3. Some of you will be asked to create a `demo
video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8LRJHkTqsg&list=PLs5n5nYB22fIdV_HMkekxx7Yt06lXUptT>`__
that can help other learners with planning their projects.

Your Presentation
-----------------

You will be creating a slide deck based on the same template used for
the `Capstone Project Demo
videos <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8LRJHkTqsg&list=PLs5n5nYB22fIdV_HMkekxx7Yt06lXUptT>`__.

You may start with the template in one of the following formats: 

- `Google Slides <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Iuol2AdtEnVFTreOW9fBF71ZJbXvA--zI2mrxQzdP7o/edit#slide=id.p>`__
- `Powerpoint <https://www.dropbox.com/s/tvdipbfilwmtf8v/capstone-presentation-template.pptx?dl=0>`__

To download the Powerpoint template, select *Download* from the menu at the top right of the Dropbox page.

If you use Google Slides, you will need to first copy the document in
order to make a version that you can edit.

In addition to the videos linked above, you may refer to a :download:`demo
version <./presentation-demo.pdf>` of the presentation.

.. tip:: 

   If you deployed your application, add the URL of where your app is hosted to one of your presentation slides (the main slide or the Demo slide work well for this).


When you’re done, create a PDF version of the presentation and add it to
your ``liftoff-assignments`` GitHub repository in the
``P6-Project_Presentation`` folder. Then stage, commit, and push the
changes. Submit the link to your ``liftoff-assignments`` repository via
Canvas.
