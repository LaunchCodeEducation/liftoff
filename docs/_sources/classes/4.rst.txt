Class 4: Project Review, Live Coding
====================================

Objectives
----------

Career Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Know what an interviewer is looking for from a live coding session
-  Explain and demonstrate the steps necessary for a successful live
   coding session
-  Know where to find prompts for live coding practice
-  Know how to give and receive good code review feedback

Prep Work
---------

Class 4 is an important class. We will start shifting our in-class focus
from your project to career readiness. You will still be expected to
work on your project outside of class.

You will have a project review with your mentor. They will be checking
in on the progress of your project. Your mentor knows it’s a work in
progress and doesn’t expect everything to be perfect, or even
completed. Your mentor wants to see what you have completed so far. 

Tasks
^^^^^

- Prepare for the project review. More on this :ref:`below <project-review-prep>`
- Complete the module :ref:`live-coding`
- Review week 4 of the demo projects: :ref:`Event List Week 4 <el-week-4>` | :ref:`Expense Tracker Week 4 <et-week-4>`

Project Review Prep
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The project review is very important. You need to make constant progress
on your project to show employers you are ready for a job. We want to
ensure you are making progress, and will do so with a review of your project.

In your Class 4 project review, *your application should have the
following in order to remain enrolled in the class*: 1. A working
landing page 2. At least one complete user story.

You are more than welcome to show off multiple completed user stories 
and multiple pages, but you must have at least a working landing page
and one completed user story to pass this assignment and
stay enrolled in the class.

*The best way to prepare for this meeting is to spend a lot of time
working on your project*. As such, you will have no extra prep work outside of
the Live Coding prep work listed below.

In Class
--------

Your focus for the project module this week, and going forward, should
be on making as much progress on your project as possible each week. If
you reach a point where you have finished all of your pending user
stories, you should write more.

Lecture: How do I show my technical skills in a live coding setting?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Live coding has been used in technical interviews for years. We will
have a brief lecture and an example of what a live coding instance is
like.

Lecture: How do I give and receive code review feedback?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In class today, we will discuss how to best address and give code review
feedback when working with others.

Activity: Standup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before having your one-on-one project review, you should conduct your
standup. Each person should go around and state what tasks they got done
this week and what they are working on next week.

Activity: Live Coding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pair up with another student. Take turns playing the interviewer and
interviewee. This is your chance to practice before the assignment next
week. If you have questions, feel free to talk the problem over with your
partner, or pull in one of your mentors.

Activity: Project Review
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will sit down with your mentor one-on-one and demo what progress you
have made so far. You might not feel like you’ve made much progress, but 
you still need to show your mentor what you’ve done, and what you plan on 
doing next.

To pass this assignment, you must have: 

#. A working landing page 
#. At least one functioning and completed user story
